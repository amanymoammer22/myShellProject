Welcome to myshell
-------------------

myshell is a simple UNIX-like command-line shell with basic internal command support and I/O redirection.

Usage:
------

- Run `./myshell` to start the shell interactively.
- Run `./myshell filename` to execute commands from a batch file.

Supported Internal Commands:
----------------------------

1. cd <directory>     : Change current directory or show if none.
2. clr                : Clear the screen.
3. dir <directory>    : List contents of the directory.
4. environ            : Show all environment variables.
5. echo <message>     : Display the message.
6. help               : Show this manual using 'more'.
7. pause              : Wait until Enter is pressed.
8. quit               : Exit the shell.

I/O Redirection:
----------------

You can use:
- `< file`    to read input from a file.
- `> file`    to write output to a file (overwrite).
- `>> file`   to append output to a file.

Examples:
---------

- `ls -l > output.txt`            → saves listing to file
- `sort < data.txt > sorted.txt`  → reads input from one and writes to another

Background Execution:
---------------------

Use `&` at the end of the command to run it in background.

Example:
- `sleep 10 &`

Environment Variables:
----------------------

- `shell`   → Path of the myshell executable.
- `parent`  → Used for child processes invoked from the shell.
